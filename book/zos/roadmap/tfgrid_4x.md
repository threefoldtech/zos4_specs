# TFGrid 4.x

We have always differentiated ourselves from a crypto project. Our belief is in utilizing a token as a utility for creating and using IT (Internet) capacity, which is essential for enabling our digital lives. 

This approach makes the token a true commodity. Starting with TFGrid 4.x, we are implementing changes that will further set us apart from typical crypto projects:

- We will use a cooperative as our decentralization mechanism, these are well proven governance structures.
- A 100% owned subsidiary of the Cooperative in a chosen jurisdiction (probably BVI) will allow the creation of Farming Pools and allow people to buy/sell their TFT in controlled ways in line with governance, as will be defined per Farming Pool.


### ThreeFold Cooperative


- Every farmer and buyer of IT Capacity from the TFGrid will be part of this cooperative.

### ThreeFold Farming Pools

- Every ThreeFold 4.0 Farmer will be required to join a ThreeFold Farming Pool. As part of this process, they must adhere to minimum service level agreements, including commitments to uptime, response time, and available bandwidth. They will also need to sign a service agreement and agree to specific terms and conditions. 
- Farmers will have the opportunity to set the pricing for the services they provide, such as storage, network, and computing capacity. 
- Farmers have the option to stake TFT on their farms. This staking enables a 'slashing' mechanism, where a portion of their stake may be forfeited if they fail to meet their service level commitments, thereby enhancing the overall quality and reliability of the network.
- Farming Pools will provide a regulated centralized approach to staking/holding/selling/buying of TFT.

### TFT as used to buy capacity on TFGrid will be distributed as follows:

- 20% to TF Cooperative
- 80% to the Farmers of the selected capacity

### Conclusion


We believe that this strategy effectively merges the best of both worlds. The TFGrid remains decentralized and distributed, yet this approach allows for greater control over the quality of the delivered services. 

Additionally, by halting the minting of new TFTs, we anticipate a positive impact on the market value of the TFT, aligning with our commitment to sustainable and value-driven growth.
