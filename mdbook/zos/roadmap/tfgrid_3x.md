# TFGrid 3.x

ThreeFold DMCC has been instrumental in supporting the expansion of the TFGrid over the last years. It is thanks to the generous funding and support of many contributors thatTFGrid has been able to achieve its current state. ThreeFold DMCC will in the future limit its effort on TFGrid 3.x and focus completely on TFGrid 4.x. For this reason, TFGrid 3.x must move to become fully decentralized.

### The following are important next steps:

We need at least 9 guardians: every guardian will run the validator nodes required to keep the TFGrid fully functioning. See more info below.

- The minting (farming) rules are becoming more strict thanks to a recently passed GEP (Grid Enhancement Proposal). 
  - Only 3Nodes which have enough uptime, have good enough internet connection and are usable for deployments in enough quality will receive rewards. 
  - The TFGrid Guardians will verify the minting (as is done by code) every month and approve the distribution after getting consensus. 
  - These stricter minting rules may mean that some 3Nodes will no longer be available on the TFGrid.
  - Starting Jan 1 2024, new 3Nodes added to TFGrid 3.x will have a lockup of 2 years on the generated TFT or until at least 30% of their capacity has been used for a specific number of months. This was in the original specs of our TFGrid. The farming reward will be expressed in USD and converted to TFT using the price at the time of minting (with a minimum of 0.08 USD per TFT).
- The Guardians will also look for contributors for example on the forum and the different ThreeFold chats. The Guardians also decide on upgrades of the TFGrid codebase.
- A system like https://explorer.gitcoin.co/ or an alternative will be chosen by the guardians to manage the funding of the TFGrid enhancements. ThreeFold Cloud will be a sponsor to this system and might choose to participate in the development of some of the required components as specified in this system. The TFGrid Treasury will also be a sponsor.

### TF Distribution

TFT as used to buy capacity on TFGrid will be distributed as follows:

- 25% to TF Cooperative
- 25% to people who chose to stake on the nodes of the guardians.
- 50% burning of the TFT.

All terms and conditions will be with a newly created ThreeFold Cooperative (or a 100% owned subsidiary). Every person farming or using the capacity of the TFGrid 3.x will have to be a member of this cooperative and sign T&C.
