# Trends

## Basic Cloud or Dedicated Servers not needed to compete with

- the marketleaders have been adding so many features and so many programs around it might be confusing to try to add value here.
- pricing we might be much better but thats not good enough of a future
- storage is dead long live storage, there are many storage offerings while we can be more innovative with our quantum safe storage system, its not so easy to compete on raw storage capacity, check out offerings like Sia, StorJ, they don't have much traction and pricing is already super low.

## crypto decentralization for infrastructure is in trouble

- its "not so funny", but to be expected, the big hype of decentralization through blockchain is gone, most realize it was a big hype to make the few rich on the many.
- most decentralized infrastructure projects are struggling and not able to get traction, so many of the so called unicorns are not growing much.

main reasons

- to outsource your infrastructure needs you need to trust the provider, how do you do that in decentralized context.
  - e.g. buying storage for Archive usecase is like buying an insurance
- SLA's are the real name of the game, how to get an SLA through a blockchain DAO
- regulation, there are strong regulations for service providers, again not trivial to implement in pure blockchain decentralization
- trust: how to trust a DAO, democratic governing communities don't allways run that smoothly, people migh prefer to be able to call someone and be helped no matter what their issue is.
- pump & dump, many realized that some some of these project ended up being a pump & dump, where smart investors made lots of money and the masses lost a lot of money


## What are people looking for

### vs Centralized offerings

- the services are super complicated, API's confusing, UI's confusing, it needs to be all more easy
- its damn expensive
- many countries don't have their local capacity (local service offerings), most capacity is deployed in Europe or US, good luck finding something in e.g. Africa.
- flexible services, easy to scale out or down
- transparent pricing policies (often not easy to understand where the money goes too)
- sovereignity is just a dream, maybe some sentences in a contract


### vs Decentralized offerings

- find ways how to enforce SLA's
- strong reputation management (how do we know which providers can be trusted)
- we need to be able to define where the service is operating
- more scalability and higher performance
  - many of the algorithmic driven projects are slow, too slow
- many projects are way too simple in design and narrow in scope
  - the vision of having to integrate with 10+ web3 infrastructure projects might not be realistic
- make it easy for customer to get support, this is so important in any business

### simplicity

- it all needs to be more easy and easier to understand
- conversational interfaces might help

### the AI wave is too big to ignore

- AI is changing everything, any new offering needs to embrace this.
