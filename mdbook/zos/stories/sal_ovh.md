# SAL OVH

- ask test account in OVH (see with Peter, needs to be separate account)
- document all in git.ourworld.tf/tftech/itenv_grid4_engineering
  - which nodes are used
  - API credentials
- Create nice SAL as client for OVH  
  - see which nodes can be bought from auction
  - see which nodes are deployed
  - buy dedicated node once selection made
  - install the node with arch and chosen SSH key
  - reboot the node (stop, start)
  - ip addr mgmt?

Remarks

- try not to have local state appart from e.g. credentials
- load all in mem struct whil working with OVH
